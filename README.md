### Introduction
> CrystalCSS is a baseplate design for websites!

Our goal is to help get your website off the ground quickly with minimal styling, on your end. Less time spent trying to figure out **CSS** equals more time to work on important things, like backend development, or doing fun things with JQuerry!
